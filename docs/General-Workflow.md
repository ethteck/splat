# General workflow

This describes an example of how to iteratively edit the splat segments config in order to maximise code and data migration from the binary.

# 1 Initial configuration

After successfully following the [Quickstart](https://github.com/ethteck/splat/wiki/Quickstart), you should have an initial configuration like the one below:

```yaml
- name: main
  type: code
  start: 0x1060
  vram: 0x80070C60
  follows_vram: entry
  bss_size: 0x3AE70
  subsegments:
      - [0x1060, asm]
      # ... a lot of additional `asm` sections
      # This section is found out to contain __osViSwapContext
      - [0x25C20, asm, energy_orb_wave]
      # ... a lot of additional `asm` sections
      - [0x2E450, data]

      - [0x3E330, rodata]
      # ... a lot of additional `rodata` sections
      - { start: 0x3F1B0, type: bss, vram: 0x800E9C20 }

- [0x3F1B0, bin]
```

## 1.1 Match `rodata` to `asm` sections

It's good practice to start pairing `rodata` sections with `asm` sections _before_ changing the `asm` sections into `c` files. This is because rodata may need to be explicitly included within the `c` file (via `INCLUDE_RODATA` or `GLOBAL_ASM` macros).

`splat` provides hints about which `rodata` segments are referenced by which `asm` segments based on references to these symbols within the disassembled functions.

These messages are output when splitting and look like:

```plain_text
Rodata segment '3EE10' may belong to the text segment 'energy_orb_wave'
    Based on the usage from the function func_0xXXXXXXXX to the symbol D_800AEA10
```

To pair these two sections, simply add the _name_ of the suggested text (i.e. `asm`) segment to the `rodata` segment:

```yaml
- [0x3EE10, rodata, energy_orb_wave] # segment will be paired with a text (i.e. asm or c) segment named "energy_orb_wave"
```

**NOTE:**

By default `migrate_rodata_to_functions` functionality is enabled. This causes splat to include paired rodata along with the disassembled assembly code, allowing it to be linked via `.rodata` segments from the get-go. This guide assumes that you will disable this functionality until you have successfully paired up the segments.

### Troubleshooting

#### Multiple `rodata` segments for a single text segment

Using the following configuration:
```yaml
# ...
- [0x3E900, rodata]
- [0x3E930, rodata]
# ...
```

`splat` outputs a hint that doesn't immediately seem to make sense:

```
Rodata segment '3E900' may belong to the text segment '16100'
    Based on the usage from the function func_80085DA0 to the symbol jtbl_800AE500

Rodata segment '3E930' may belong to the text segment '16100'
    Based on the usage from the function func_800862C0 to the symbol jtbl_800AE530
```

This hint tells you that `splat` believes one text segment references two `rodata` sections. This usually means that either the `rodata` should not be split at `0x3E930`, or that there is a missing split in the `asm` at `0x16100`, as a text segment can only have one `rodata` segment.

If we assume that the rodata split is incorrect, we can remove the extraneous split:

```yaml
# ...
- [0x3E900, rodata, "16100"]
# ...
```

**NOTE:** Splat uses heuristics to determine `rodata` and `asm` splits and is not perfect - false positives are possible and, if in doubt, double-check the assembly yourself before changing the splits.


### Multiple `asm` segments referring to the same `rodata` segment

Sometimes the opposite is true, and `splat` believes two `asm` segments belong to a single `rodata` segment. In this case, you can split the `asm` segment to make sure two files are not paired with the same `rodata`. Note that this too can be a false positive.


# 2 Disassemble text, data, rodata

Let's say you want to start decompiling the subsegment at `0x25C20` (`energy_orb_wave`). Start by replacing the `asm` type with `c`, and then re-run splat.

```yaml
- [0x25C20, c, energy_orb_wave]
# ...
- [0x3EE10, rodata, energy_orb_wave]
```

This will disassemble the ROM at `0x25C20` as code, creating individual `.s` files for each function found. The output will be located in `{asm_path}/nonmatchings/energy_orb_wave/<function_name>.s`.

Assuming `data` and `rodata` segments have been paired with the `c` segment, splat will generate `{asm_path}/energy_orb_wave.data.s` and `{asm_path}/energy_orb_wave.rodata.s` respectively.

Finally, splat will generate a C file, at `{src_path}/energy_orb_wave.c` containing macros that will be used to include all disassembled function assembly.

**NOTE:**
- the path for where assembly is written can be configured via `asm_path`, the default is `{base_dir}/asm`
- the source code path can be configured via `src_path`, the default is `{base_path}/src`

## Macros

The macros to include text/rodata assembly are different for GCC vs IDO compiler:

**GCC**: `INCLUDE_ASM` & `INCLUDE_RODATA` (text/rodata respectively)
**IDO**: `GLOBAL_ASM`

These macros must be defined in an included header, which splat currently does not produce.

For a GCC example, see the [include.h](https://github.com/AngheloAlf/drmario64/blob/master/include/include_asm.h) from the Dr. Mario project.

For IDO, you will need to use [asm-processor](https://github.com/simonlindholm/asm-processor) in order to include assembly code within the c files.

## Assembly macros

splat relies on some assembly macros for the asm generation. They usually live on the `include/macro.inc` file. Without these macros then an assembler would not be able to build our disassemblies.

Those macros usually look like this:

```mips
.macro glabel label
    .global \label
    .type \label, @function
    \label:
.endm

.macro dlabel label
    .global \label
    \label:
.endm

.macro jlabel label
    .global \label
    \label:
.endm
```

Where `glabel` is used for functions, `dlabel` is used for data, rodata and bss variables and `jlabel` is used for branch labels used by jumptables.

Asm differ tools can sometimes struggle to show diffs with `jlabel`s when combined with certain compilers. A workaround for this issue is to mark the `jlabel` as a function, like this:

```mips
.macro jlabel label
    .global \label
    .type \label, @function
    \label:
.endm
```

### Float assembly macros

Additionally splat recommends using the o32 abi names for float registers, which gives proper names to the float registers.

For a proper explanation on what those abi names are and why they are recommended check this: <https://gist.github.com/EllipticEllipsis/27eef11205c7a59d8ea85632bc49224d>

Some compilers/assemblers have support for them but others do not, if your compiler doesn't support them then but does support having custom register aliases (like the modern `mips-linux-gnu-as` and similar assemblers) then it is recommended to add the following to your `macro.inc` file:

```mips
# Float register aliases (o32 ABI, odd ones are rarely used)

.set $fv0,          $f0
.set $fv0f,         $f1
.set $fv1,          $f2
.set $fv1f,         $f3
.set $ft0,          $f4
.set $ft0f,         $f5
.set $ft1,          $f6
.set $ft1f,         $f7
.set $ft2,          $f8
.set $ft2f,         $f9
.set $ft3,          $f10
.set $ft3f,         $f11
.set $fa0,          $f12
.set $fa0f,         $f13
.set $fa1,          $f14
.set $fa1f,         $f15
.set $ft4,          $f16
.set $ft4f,         $f17
.set $ft5,          $f18
.set $ft5f,         $f19
.set $fs0,          $f20
.set $fs0f,         $f21
.set $fs1,          $f22
.set $fs1f,         $f23
.set $fs2,          $f24
.set $fs2f,         $f25
.set $fs3,          $f26
.set $fs3f,         $f27
.set $fs4,          $f28
.set $fs4f,         $f29
.set $fs5,          $f30
.set $fs5f,         $f31
```

If even this doesn't work on your assembler then you would need to disable those abi names by setting the `mips_abi_float_regs` option in your yaml to `numeric`.

Old GCC builds (like KMC) can struggle with register aliases, a workaround is to split the macro labels and the aliases in two different files. You can follow the example from Dr. Mario: [`labels.inc`](https://github.com/AngheloAlf/drmario64/blob/master/include/labels.inc) and [`macro.inc`](https://github.com/AngheloAlf/drmario64/blob/master/include/macro.inc)

# 3 Decompile text

This involved back and forth between `.c` and `.s` files:

- editing the `data.s`, `rodata.s` files to add/fixup symbols at the proper locations
- decompiling functions, declaring symbols (`extern`s) in the `.c`

The linker script links
- `.text` (only) from the `.o` built from `energy_orb_wave.c`
- `.data` (only) from the `.o` built from `energy_orb_wave.data.s`
- `.rodata` (only) from the `.o` built from `energy_orb_wave.rodata.s`

# 4 Decompile (ro)data

Migrate data to the .c file, using raw values, lists or structs as appropriate code.

Once you have paired the rodata and text segments together, you can enabled `migrate_rodata_to_functions`. This will add the paired rodata into each individual function's assembly file, and therefore, the rodata will end up in the compiled .o file.

To link the .data/.rodata from the .o built from the .c file (instead of from the .s files), the subsegments must be changed from:

```yaml
- [0x42100, c, energy_orb_wave]
- [0x42200, data, energy_orb_wave]     # extract data at this ROM address as energy_orb_wave.data.s
- [0x42300, rodata, energy_orb_wave]   # extract rodata at this ROM address as energy_orb_wave.rodata.s
```

to:

```yaml
- [0x42100, c, energy_orb_wave]
- [0x42200, .data, energy_orb_wave]    # take the .data section from the compiled c file named energy_orb_wave
- [0x42300, .rodata, energy_orb_wave]  # take the .rodata section from the compiled c file named energy_orb_wave
```


**NOTE:**
If using `auto_all_section` and there are no other `data`/`.data`/`rodata`/`.rodata` in the subsegments in the code segment, the subsegments can also be changed to

```yaml
- [0x42100, c, energy_orb_wave]
- [0x42200]
```

# 5 Decompile bss

`bss` works in a similar way to data/rodata. However, `bss` is usually discarded from the final binary, which makes it somewhat tricker to migrate.

The `bss` segment will create assembly files that are full of `space`. The `.bss` segment will link the `.bss` section of the referenced `c` file.

# 6 Done!

`.text`, `.data`, `.rodata` and `.bss` are linked from the .o built from `energy_orb_wave.c` which now has everything to match when building

The assembly files (functions .s, data.s and rodata.s files) can be deleted
